       <h2>Kitty</h2>
        <p>This is my cat, Kitty. He is the first
            cat we got back when I was in High school.
        He came unexpectedly to us after my dad came home
            one day and said, "Oh yea, I brought a cat".
        His bipolar personality used to make it hard to 
            decipher whether he was trying to be sweet 
        or just bite us. Years later after being neutured,
            he is more sweet and enjoys kisses. 
        He makes a good cuddle buddy and will follow you around.

        <h2>Pelusa</h2>
        <p>This is our most recent adpotee. My mom named 
            her "Pelusa" which means fluff is Spanish. As a kitten,
            she was very shy and stayed close to her mother. 
            After she was separated from her mother, she became more
            playful with the other cats in my house. She has a sweet 
            personality, she seldom bites or acts aggressive. 
            In the mornings, she likes to run around everywhere 
            with our other cat "Rosalia".
            She is always sweet, awake or asleep.
