   <h2>About Meself</h2> 
<p>Hello my name is Ivan Kim, a student taking CIS 162. 
    This is the third class I take at Cerritos as well as
    the first class I take towards web development. 
    For some time I knew I wanted to major in Computer Science. 
    Computer Science itself can be a very general major and I did 
    not know specifically what it is I wanted to do. 
    Most stem majors require various math courses which 
    was not something I was interested in. Through time 
    and personal experience, I found myself intrigued with 
    the design apect of building websites. Apart from learning 
    html and css, I want to take courses on photoshopping.</p>
    
<h1>When I have free time</h1>
<ul>
    <li>I like to cook food for my family</li>
    <li>I like to workout</li>
    <li>I play clash royale while surfing the web researching random topics.</li>
</ul>    
    
    <p>My favorite web site is <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google.com</a> because
        it is a reliable search engine for my research needs. </p>
